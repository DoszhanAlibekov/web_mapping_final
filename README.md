## Web for the future studies of bike lane projects

This is a NYU Web mapping class final project.

This project services as the web tool for planners and decision makers to 
eplore two of the current NYC Department of Transportation bike lane
projects and its existing conditions. This tool can be used for future
analysis of bike lane usage, bus ridership, and other activities that share
the same public space with those two newly constructed bike lanes.
